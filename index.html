                    Running is a popular form of exercise for a reason. It doesnâ€™t
                    need much equipment, and you can do it just about
                    anywhere or anytime it is convenient for you. Plus, experts say

                    Running, or jogging, is one of the best cardio exercises you
                    can do. Running for at least 10 minutes a day can
                    significantly lower your risk of cardiovascular disease. Runners
                    lower their chances of dying from heart disease by
                    half.

                    Quality sleep is essential for your health. Your body repair
                    s itself when you're asleep, which is why you wake up
                    feeling refreshed. But try to avoid running too late in the
                    day. This can interfere with how well you sleep at night.
                    Aerobic exercise triggers a release of endorphins, chemicals
                    that help relieve pain or stress. These activate the brain
                    and might keep you awake.
